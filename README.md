# Auto_DNS
This code allows you to automatically install and configure a DNS service, you will only provide the domain name and the server name, with these simple steps you will have a DNS service with a functional MX record.  Attention >> Code thought and tested in CentOS and Red Hat distros, soon for Debian distros.

PLEASE DID NOT USE ON ANY PRODUCTION SCENARIO. ONLY ON LABS. BECAUSE IT'S TURN OF THE FIREWALL, IF YOU WANT YOU CAN ADD YOUR OWN FIREWALL RULES.
